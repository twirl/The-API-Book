### On versioning

Here and throughout we firmly stick to [semver](https://semver.org/) principles of versioning:
  1. API versions are denoted with three numbers, i.e. `1.2.3`.
  1. First number (major version) when backwards incompatible changes in the API are shipped.
  2. Second Number (minor version) increases when new functionality is added to the API, keeping backwards compatibility intact.
  3. Third number (patch) increases when new API version contains bug fixes only.

Terms ‘major API version’ and ‘new API version, containing backwards incompatible changes to functionality’ are therefore to be considered as equivalent.

In Section II we will discuss versioning policies in more details. In Section I we will just use semver versions designation, specifically `v1`, `v2`, etc.

This is the working repository for ‘The API’ book written by Sergey Konstantinov ([email](mailto:yatwirl@gmail.com), [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/twirl), [Medium blog](https://twirl.medium.com)).

API-first development is one of the hottest technical topics nowadays since many companies started to realize that API serves as a multiplicator to their opportunities—but it also amplifies the design mistakes as well.

This book is written to share the expertise and describe the best practices in designing and developing APIs. It comprises six sections dedicated to:
  * The API design
  * API patterns
  * backwards compatibility
  * HTTP API & REST
  * SDK and UI libraries
  * API product management.

## Current State and the Roadmap

The second edition of the book is finished! This is everything I ever wanted to tell the reader.

There are several areas to improve:
  * Add more diagrams
  * Add more live code examples (specifically — `SearchBox` designed in MVP paradigm and using React/Redux).

## Contributing

I am accepting inquiries. Feel free to open issues.

I am NOT accepting pull requests introducing any new content, since I'm willing to be the only author. I would gratefully accept typo fixes, though.
